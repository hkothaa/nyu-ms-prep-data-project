NYU MS Prep – Data & SQL Practice

This is a beginner-friendly project created to practice SQL, data analysis, and GitHub fundamentals before beginning my MS in Technology & Information Management at NYU (January 2026).

It includes a small dataset and simple SQL queries to build comfort with databases — a core skill for courses like Database Management and Quantitative Methods for Business Analysis.
